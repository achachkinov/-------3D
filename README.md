hello, this is my pet-project, and i'll briefly tell you how it works

the server of game is started via a file gameServerStart.js
when connecting to the server, an html document homepage is sent, from where you can either create a room for the game, or join a ready-made room

later I’ll add how it works, but for now I’ll go to bed
